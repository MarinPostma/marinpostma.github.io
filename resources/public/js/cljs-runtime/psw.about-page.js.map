I am also obsessed with human-machine interface design, reading, music and learning new things. I am currently looking for an internship in a mid-size tech startup, as a rust software engineer.\n\n#Education\n  I picked up Engineering school in 2014, with my first year mostly consisting of Math and Physic classes.  \n  I quickly realised that I needed to broaden my horizons, and cultivate my creative drives, so 2 years in I decided to take a gap year and join **Shenkar**, in Tel Aviv for a semester to learn more about **Interaction Design**. There I learnt about design, but most importantly I learnt to work with people coming from very different perspective than me. This is also when I picked up a deep passion for computer programming.\n\n  Coming back to Paris after a year abroad I figured that I wanted to get more involved with coding, so I took my shot at **42**, Xavier Niel's disrupting coding school. After an intense month of selection, I was admited, and started working both 42 and ISEP at the same time. I grew a deep interest in Unix development, algorithms, and AI. I majored in **Business Inteligence** and took Andrew Ng's **Deep Learning Specialization** on coursera for the later, and specialized in Unix development at 42.\n\n# Experiences\n## **Product Manager Intern** - My Job Glasses\n### Saas company for HR and networking platform students to meet professionals\n#### Accomplishements\n- Supervised product roadmap and implemented new features based on user feedback, including preparing the release of x\n- Created the company\u2019s data analysis framework and made weekly analysis of the result which lead to the creation of a new position in the company.
